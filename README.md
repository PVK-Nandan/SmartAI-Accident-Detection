🚀 Project Name: Smart AI-Based Accident Detection & Alert System using CNN - Deep Learning
🌍 SDG Goal: SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities & Communities (Making cities safer with smart accident response systems).

📌 Problem Statement Many accident victims lose their lives because help doesn’t reach them on time. In remote areas, accidents often go unnoticed for hours, and emergency services rely on people to report them, which causes delays. If there is no mobile network, victims cannot even call for help. Our project automates accident detection using AI and CCTV monitoring and sends instant alerts with live location details to nearby hospitals and police stations, ensuring faster response times and saving lives.

🚨 Problems We Face Without This System : ❌ Delayed Help for Accident Victims ❌ No Automatic Accident Monitoring ❌ No Communication in Remote Areas

✅ How Our Project Works 🚗 1. AI-Based Live Road Monitoring Uses CCTV cameras to monitor roads in real time. AI model detects accidents automatically using deep learning. Uses OpenCV & skimage for image processing. 📡 2. Instant Alerts with Live Location Extracts accident location (latitude & longitude) using geocoder & geopy. Sends automatic SMS alerts to nearby hospitals & police stations. Uses Twilio API for message delivery. 🖥 3. Web Dashboard for Live Monitoring Displays real-time CCTV footage with accident detection. Logs accident alerts for authorities to take immediate action.

🛠 Tech Stack & Libraries Used : CNN Library Use Case os: Handles system-level file operations cv2 (OpenCV): Processes CCTV footage & detects accidents math : Calculates distances between locations geocoder : Fetches accident location from IP requests : Connects to APIs for location services pandas : Stores and manages accident records twilio : Sends emergency SMS alerts geopy : Converts coordinates to real-world locations keras : Builds the deep learning accident detection model numpy : Handles numerical computations tensorflow : Trains AI models for accident detection matplotlib : Visualizes accident reports skimage : Enhances image processing for detection

🌟 Impact & Benefits ✅ Faster medical response = More lives saved. ✅ Works even in network-less areas using alternate communication methods. ✅ Makes cities safer & smarter (Aligns with SDG 11). ✅ Can be used in highways, cities, and rural areas.
